Symbolic (Java) PathFinder for Detecting Injection Vulnerabilites:
---------------------------

This JPF extension provides symbolic execution for Java bytecode.
It performs a non-standard interpretation of byte-codes.
Currently, it allows symbolic execution on methods with arguments of basic types
(int, long, double, boolean, etc.). Symbolic input globals and method
pre-conditions are specified via user annotations (see symbc/examples and
symbc/test).
